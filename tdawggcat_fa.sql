We were confused and in pain, but we found hope in our FA meetings.</p><p>We can’t tell you what to do. We can only share our experiences with you and tell you how we found the strength to deal with our problems. Some of us have loved ones who are recovering from addictive disease. Others of us have loved ones who choose not to recover, at least for the present.</p><p>We’ve learned that we can live fuller, richer lives by studying and practicing the Twelve Steps of Families Anonymous. The despair that brought us to this program no longer dominates our lives. We have learned that we have rights and deserve to be happy, but it’s up to us to create that happiness. These changes did not come about overnight. They happened because we attended our FA meetings, found sponsors, studied the Steps, made phone calls to other members, and turned to a Power greater than ourselves. You are no longer alone. Welcome to Families Anonymous.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> open myself to another so that both of us can be helped.', 1),
('10', 'January 10', 'Acceptance', '<p>Acceptance is not easy. It means that I must look at a situation with honesty and with the realization that sometimes I cannot change it, cure it, or control it. It just is as it is. When I am deeply hurt, I may react with anger or rejection. Disappointment makes it difficult for me to accept the painful reality or the chemical dependency of someone I care about.</p><p>Fear also makes acceptance difficult. I want to rescue instead of letting that person learn the painful lessons of mistakes. I feel helpless, watching as he treads the thin line between rebellion and independence. He rejects my advice, and the consequences are grim.</p><p>The Twelve Steps help me realize and accept the fact that I have no power or authority over another human being. Acceptance means acknowledging that I cannot eliminate chemical dependency, any more than I can make a sick person well.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> invite acceptance to put an end to futile struggles and set me free to grow.', 10),
('100', 'April 9', 'Needing People', '<p>There’s a line in a song that goes, “People who need people are the luckiest people in the world.” I’m one of those lucky people. I’ll be the first to admit that I do need people. I need the people of Families Anonymous.</p><p>When I found FA, my heart was broken in a million pieces, and I didn’t know how to put it back together. I still don’t have every single piece in place, but at least my heart is mending and still beating.</p><p>The wonderful healing fellowship of FA has given me brothers and sisters to whom I can relate, for we are all one with the same problem.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> open my heart to another person as a way to help myself heal.', 100),
('101', 'April 10', 'One Day at a Time', '<p>One day at a time.“Oh, there’s another one of those slogans. They sound all right at meetings, but putting them into practice is another thing.”</p><p>That’s how I felt the first time I attended a Families Anonymous group. But little by little, I came to see that this particular slogan teaches me to be good to myself today, let go of the unhappy times of the past, and avoid worrying about tomorrow.</p><p>It invites me to fill today with as many pleasant experiences as I can and to help others do the same.</p><p>Living one day at a time is especially necessary for those of us who know the pain and confusion of the family disease called chemical dependency. It’s all too easy for us to project problems into the future that may never materialize. Fortunately, we have our friends in FA to help us remember to live one day at a time.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> make this one day a celebration of life.', 101),
('102', 'April 11', 'Self-Pity', '<p>One member of our Families Anonymous group told us that she was so crushed and defeated by her child’s drug addiction that she walked everywhere with her head down and her eyes cast low, so that no one could see her hurt and despair. By doing so, she kept her field of vision extremely limited—cracked sidewalks, bird droppings, mud puddles, and dirty shoes.</p><p>When she found Families Anonymous and stepped out on the Twelve Step road to recovery, she raised her head to see the break in the clouds with sunlight shining through, the birds darting from tree to tree, a rainbow after a shower.</p><p>Had she continued to wallow in self-pity, her eyes would have remained closed to the beauty in each day. If we dwell on the hurts and miseries of yesterday and dread the possible pain of tomorrow, we miss out completely on today.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> broaden my outlook, appreciating the gifts this new day brings.', 102),
('103', 'April 12', 'Self', '<p>“Self” is a powerful word. Attached to other words, it carries either a negative or a positive message. Like so many other intangibles, its impact depends upon the way we use it.</p><p>When we come into the Families Anonymous program, our “selves” are usually negative ones: self-doubt, self-recrimination, self-pity, self-justification, self-blame. At times, we behave in ways that are self-centered, self-serving, self-defeating, and just plain selfish. We do not recognize that we are self-imprisoned in our denial and unwillingness to change.</p><p>But as we work the Twelve Steps, we discover some other “selves”: self-awareness, self-respect, self-control, self-confidence, self-esteem. “I can change myself,” our FA reading tells us. As we grow and change, we discover the lovable, worthy selves that have been there all along.</p><p>If we continue reaching for the positive “selves” that are ours to claim, we eventually arrive at the best “self” of all: selflessness. When we get to that point, nothing pleases our new self more than sharing the program with someone who needs it. As we discover who we are, we let go of negativism and self-centered ways.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> become the best self I can be.', 103),
('104', 'April 13', 'Lessons', '<p>I had to learn to accept many things when I started coming to Families Anonymous. The first thing was powerlessness. Surely I couldn’t be powerless over my own son! After all, hadn’t I managed to control him all these years? Well, if I had, what a mess I’d made of it!</p><p>Now that I have turned over all that control to my Higher Power, things certainly are working better. It’s funny how much we can learn in FA when we get honest with ourselves. And being honest with myself was the second thing I learned in FA.</p><p>How often I had tried to justify my faults. I always had such good reasons for what I said or did! Somehow the truth stands out when we read the FA material over and over.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> acknowledge the many lessons my FA program has taught me.', 104),
('105', 'April 14', 'Control', '<p>Oh, how I tried to control everyone in my life! But all I ended up with was frustration and anger. Why couldn’t my family see that I knew what was best for everyone?</p><p>Thank God I found the Families Anonymous program, for it showed me how to release my loved ones from the tyranny of my nagging ways. Through the FA program, I learned to gain a measure of control over myself—the only person I am capable of controlling. What a feeling of freedom came when I gave up trying to manipulate everybody else’s life and concentrated on doing something positive about my own!</p><p>When I find myself starting to take over again, I remember who is really in charge of my family and me, and I give back to my Higher Power the control I had thought was mine.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> ask my Higher Power to remove any urge I may have to control other people or situations.', 105),
('106', 'April 15', 'Roles', '<p>I kept saying to myself, “My daughter is the one with the problems. She’s the addict who causes all the upheaval in our family.” That was before I found Families Anonymous.</p><p>As I became better informed about addiction, I learned that this disease gets better only when the addict wants it to get better, regardless of how much the family may long for changes.</p><p>Coming to meetings and faithfully reading FA literature, I learned that each member of our family was playing a role. We either helped her move toward recovery or stood in her way. Until we all became aware of the roles we were playing—enabler, persecutor, rescuer, or victim—we would interact in the same old ways, and nothing would change.</p><p>With this new understanding of the addict’s personality and disease, I no longer allow myself to be manipulated or dragged down by the turmoil of her life.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> look carefully at the role I’ve been playing, and then I will take the lead in my own life.', 106),
('107', 'April 16', 'Enabling', '<p>We talk a lot in Families Anonymous about “enabling.” What do we mean? We mean continuing to do those things that allow another person to remain “stuck” in the disease of addiction. Enabling means relieving someone of life’s normal consequences, thereby short-circuiting the process of growth.</p><p>It is so easy for me to step in and “help” when I know I should step back and allow that other person’s room to grow by suffering the consequences of his own mistakes. At times it would be convenient for me to offer help, I find it extremely painful to see my addict struggle alone, although he may be making progress in his own way.</p><p>I find it hard to allow him to suffer pain when I could ease that pain by my enabling. I sometimes think of him as a slow learner, yet when I realize how guilty I am of enabling, I think, “Who am I to judge another person?”</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> remember that when I relieve the pain, I only prolong the illness.', 107),
('108', 'April 17', 'Helping or Controlling?', '<p>How easy it was for me to take over and direct someone I regarded as sick and unable to function! Even after my daughter was in recovery, I continued trying to engineer her life—under the guise of keeping her on the right track. I thought it was not only my right but my duty. Otherwise, what kind of parent would I be?</p><p>The key words are helping and controlling. Through participation in Families Anonymous, I found there is a great difference between help and control. The notion of keeping someone on track denotes control. But I know now that I have no control over any other person.</p><p>I took a long, hard look at myself and realized I needed to change my attitudes and actions. To help my daughter, I had to let her go, with love. My daughter does not need my lectures, threats, promises of rewards, or protection. She does need my encouragement, my faith that she can succeed, and my acceptance of her right to manage her own life.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> let FA help me distinguish between help and control.', 108),
('109', 'April 18', 'Helping', '<p>For me, one of the most difficult obstacles to full participation in the Families Anonymous program arose at the very onset of my involvement. I wanted desperately to help my child! How could I, a loving parent, not do things for her, especially since her use of drugs and alcohol seemed to make her so vulnerable and even more in need of help?</p><p>When I asked this question at FA meetings, the replies never satisfied me until finally I began to understand what my FA friends were trying to tell me. It gradually dawned on me that by doing things for my daughter, I was depriving her of the opportunity to experience the consequences of her behavior. So long as I kept it up, she would never have any reason to want to change her way of living.</p><p>Gradually I stopped doing and learned simply to be. I could be loving and caring without interfering in my child’s decisions. I could be understanding, knowing that she suffers from a disease called alcoholism, and recognizing that only painful experience can motivate her to choose help to get well.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> help by not interfering.', 109),
('11', 'January 11', 'Living in Fear', '<p>As I deal with the person close to me who misuses drugs, my reactions take many forms. Anxiety, fear, worry, and obsession are the chief ones. When I let my imagination run wild, it creates ever-new fears to replace the old ones. The short-lived relief when something I dreaded doesn’t happen is all too often replaced by still more fears.</p><p>This is the insanity we speak of in regard to the family disease of addiction—allowing absorption with the situation to become an obsession that drains all our energy for appreciating the gifts of life today.</p><p>I must consider alternatives or face serious consequences.

This illness often causes us to lose some of our best attributes, such as humor, imagination, and creativity.</p><p>When I realize I’ve become filled to the brim with resentment, bitterness, sarcasm, self-pity, and despair, I put my creative imagination to work. Visualizing myself as a pitcher, I mentally pour myself out, emptying myself completely of every drop of negativity, discouragement, and despair. When they are all gone, I then sit quietly for a bit and fill myself again—this time with faith, forgiveness, honesty, gratitude, patience, humor, and praise.</p><p>Once I have recharged myself with these fresh new thoughts, I can then imagine I am a cool pitcher filled from a well of serenity. Other thirsty FA members can “drink” from this same well, so they too can be refreshed.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> live in the joy that comes from thinking life-giving thoughts.', 84),
('85', 'March 25', 'The Power of Love', '<p>I have often tried to play the role of Higher Power. When I look back on my attempts, I realize how futile they were.</p><p>A Higher Power can direct, decree, demand, and judge. These are the parts of the role I usually try to play. But the Higher Power of my understanding can also show kindness, mercy, compassion, and love. And these are the attributes I am prone to overlook.</p><p>How often in the past I searched for the impossible and tried to assume a power that was not mine to possess! I set up expectations for my family and roles for my children, trying to make them clones or mirror images of myself. I created difficulties for myself and others when my hopes and dreams fell victim to reality.</p><p>My poor fantasies and unrealistic expectations can never equal the beauty and power of the true creation that surrounds us all. I can use what little power I possess to create confusion, crisis, disappointment, self-defeat, chaos, and discontent. Or I can use my power to create acceptance, harmony, loving detachment, encouragement, and peace. This is the power I wish to claim.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> create possibilities by exercising my power to love.', 85),
('86', 'March 26', 'Acceptance', '<p>One of the hardest things for me in the Families Anonymous program has been learning to let go and accept the fact that the outcome is not mine to control.</p><p>As I grow in my ability to let go, however, things do get better. I now accept the reality that my drug-dependent son suffers from a disease. I accept the fact that his behavior is often unacceptable. Even though the choices he makes are his, and his alone, I don’t have to like them or approve the way he lives his life.</p><p>Through acceptance, I become able to live my own life and involve myself in fulfilling activities without thinking of what my son might be doing with his life. I do this, recognizing all the while that what he makes of his life is up to him, so long as none of my rights get trampled on.</p><p>Acceptance has allowed me to change: from fretting and being constantly on edge to feeling free in my mind; from walking on eggs to standing firm; and from crying to caring, even amid unsolved problems.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> accept what is, stand up for myself, and work for what may yet be.', 86),
('87', 'March 27', 'Anger', '<p>Before coming to Families Anonymous, I automatically assumed another person’s anger was directed at me. Now I realize that my drug-dependent children’s anger usually has little to do with me and is often just their way of avoiding responsibility for their own actions. And often it’s their own self-hatred being projected outward onto someone or something else.</p><p>As I see my own self-confidence and inner strength grow through working the FA program, I no longer allow myself to be hurt by my children’s anger or anyone else’s. I am able to remain calmer and more objective even in the face of other people’s rage.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> claim my own serenity in spite of someone else’s anger.', 87),
('88', 'March 28', 'What FA Has Done for Me', '<p>Families Anonymous has let me know that I am not the only person in the world with family frustrations. With the support of others in my FA group, I’ve learned to maintain positive attitudes in the midst of these frustrations.</p><p>FA has helped me stop thinking of myself as a failure. The program reminds me that any failures are in the past. I know today that I can make the best of the present situation and build on it. FA has led me to accept myself first, which then helps me to be more accepting of others. Once I have done that, I can make further steps toward recovery.</p><p>FA shows me that anger is a normal human emotion, one that I can express and use constructively. I don’t allow it to dominate me.</p><p>FA reminds me that I cannot control my child. The program gives me the opportunity to stand aside, let him make his own decisions, and learn to live with the consequences.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> give thanks for all FA has taught me.', 88),

Before FA, I stared out the windows during the wee hours, paced the floors, and shed gallons of tears. Now I sleep nights and seldom find anything to cry about other than a very sad movie!</p><p>Working my program and sharing experience, strength, and hope with other FA members have given me the ability to release my child with love. I no longer try to change him. I am letting him be himself—whatever that may be. And trusting my life to a Higher Power has made the whole world seem new.</p><p>I am truly a happier person.

('9', 'January 9', 'How Important Is It?', '<p>Slogans are some of the best tools of our Families Anonymous program. Short, pithy reminders of the essentials keep us on track and out of trouble, provided we use them. With steady use, the slogans become dependable internal ‘tapes’ that can reconfigure and rebalance our thinking when we slip back into old, unproductive ways.</p><p>How important is it? is one of my favorite slogans. How important is it for me to offer my opinion at all? How important is it for me to take someone else’s inventory? How important is it to be right, listened to, or obeyed? All of these questions remind me when I am straying from the straight path of recovery, getting bogged down in detours and dead ends.</p><p>How important is it? got me through my son’s determination to wear earrings and jeans with holes in them. How important is it? reminded me that my daughter’s friends do not have to be my friends. How important is it? prodded me to get myself to an FA meeting when I was sinking into apathy and depression. We in FA know what is important for our recovery: going to meetings, working the Steps, keeping in touch by phone, and doing things that lend to our own health and well-being, regardless of what others may do.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> focus on what’s important and let the rest go.', 9),
('90', 'March 30', 'Step Eleven', '<p>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</p><p>When my life first began to crumble along with my hopes and dreams, I cried, argued, and became depressed. I tried to control, to change people, to talk sense to my addict, but I did not pray.</p><p>I needed God, so I started trying to pray. But after I found Families Anonymous and reached the point of preparing for Step Eleven, I discovered I’d been praying for control over people and events. I had been treating God as an errand boy who was supposed to carry out my orders. I was talking but never listening.</p><p>True prayer and meditation call for honest sharing of pain and hopes, reflection on all that I have learned about my role in the larger scheme of things, trust in a Higher Power, and a willingness to listen and wait.</p><p>I was grateful when I could allow Step Eleven to help me grow in patience, understanding, and wisdom.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> seek a quiet place and time to improve my conscious contact with God.', 90),
('91', 'March 31', 'Reach Out', '<p>Before my first Families Anonymous meeting, I lived in a constant state of panic. Two of my children were destroying themselves with alcohol and other drugs. I was desperate to find a way to help them.</p><p>The FA fellowship helped me realize that in order to be of help to them, I must first be willing to be helped myself. With the readings, meetings, and the Twelve Steps to rely on, I started learning to do this one day at a time.</p><p>Eventually my panic was replaced by the realization that I could not handle this crisis alone. I asked my Higher Power to give me the wisdom I desperately needed. With God’s guidance, I found the answers I sought through my FA “family.” They supplied the necessary love, encouragement, and support.</p><p>Now I keep coming back, even during my calm periods, for I want to share with others what was freely given to me.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> reach out to an FA friend.', 91),
('92', 'April 1', 'Changing', '<p>I was convinced that everything would be fine if my daughter gave up her destructive behavior. Well, she did give it up. And guess what? Life did not turn into a garden of roses. She changed, but I didn’t. She had a program and began getting well, while I continued my own obsessive efforts to manage her life, even though she was 37 years old.</p><p>Finally she let go of me and told me there was a program for people like me if I wanted to feel better. After “all I’d done for her,” I felt deserted.</p><p>But it eventually go to Families Anonymous. At first it seemed as though I had found a whole group of people who needed my help! I was probably the first person that anyone ever wanted to kick out of FA. Fortunately, my group was very patient with me. Weeks and months went by, until I finally settled down to get to know myself. What a pain I was! I certainly would not have picked me for a friend or even an acquaintance.</p><p>It takes courage to change, but I’m finding it exciting. And I intend to keep changing for the better, because I have a lifetime in which to live and grow.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> find the courage to change and be patient with myself as I do.', 92),
('93', 'April 2', 'Laughter', '<p>There was no humor in my life before I began attending Families Anonymous meetings. Devastated by crises and wrapped up in my own pain, I could find nothing to laugh at.</p><p>I remember my first FA meeting and feeling horrified that people were having a good time. Why, some members actually laughed out loud! At the time, it seemed to me like laughing at a funeral.</p><p>Before the meeting ended, I realized they had a bond. I found that honest sharing of similar experiences brings a different perspective. My burdens didn’t seem so heavy after I shared them, and I gained insight from hearing how others had handled much worse situations. At the end of that evening, I was even smiling myself.</p><p>The humor I found at FA helped me overcome my fear of being there. Humor initiated a change in my attitude, offered hope, and kept me coming back for more. Now when things get bogged down again, I remember that first meeting—and I can smile.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> take nothing too seriously, cherishing the healing power of laughter.', 93),
('94', 'April 3', 'It Works for Me', '<p>When my son entered a treatment program, I learned that chemical dependency is a disease. In the aftercare program, I learned about Families Anonymous. I felt a strong need for support in my own recovery, so I decided to give FA a try.</p><p>What a blessing! Others in the group had similar problems. I no longer felt alone. My FA group supplied caring friends and a safe place to share both problems and progress with others who understand.</p><p>Today I work on my own recovery, even though my son has not yet achieved sobriety. He continues to use drugs, and this creates many stressful situations. Without the support of FA, I wouldn’t be coping with this situation at all.</p><p>I have learned how vitally important it is for me to work my program, take care of myself, and turn my son and myself over to our Higher Power.

('95', 'April 4', 'Live and Let Live', '<p>Of the many valuable ideas I’ve gained from Families Anonymous, the slogan live and let live remains one of the most meaningful for me. It helps me keep my attention focused on living my own life as well as I can while I allow my daughter the same privilege.</p><p>When I catch myself wanting to do for her what she can do for herself, I work to change my approach by remembering to live and let live.</p><p>The same slogan has brought a bonus into another area of my life: it is helping me outgrow my tendency to judge and criticize others. When I concentrate on living my life as fully as I can, I am too busy for such nonproductive attitudes.</p><p>When I remember to live and let live, I grow in tolerance and respect for people whose attitudes and behavior differ from my own.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> live a full life while letting others do the same.', 95),
('96', 'April 5', 'Anger', '<p>When I attended Families Anonymous for the first time, I had just placed my 15-year-old daughter in a hospital for treatment of chemical dependency. I was consumed with anger and frustration over her drug use. “How could she do this to herself and her family?” And what’s wrong with us? Why couldn’t we fix this problem ourselves?</p><p>As I began to understand her illness and its destructive effects on me, my anger was soon replaced by a rekindled love for my daughter and a personal commitment to do what I could to help both of us recover.</p><p>The principles of FA have helped me change the only one I can change—myself.

('97', 'April 6', 'First FA Lesson', '<p>The first time I attended Families Anonymous, a father explained to me that my daughter’s addiction was a medically recognized disease, a condition one might compare with diabetes, in that it is incurable but can be arrested through appropriate treatment. He also told me that her addiction was not my fault.</p><p>Both of these ideas were new to me. They gave me a welcome feeling of relief and the beginnings of new insight into our situation.</p><p>At first I went to FA to help my daughter, but after a few meetings I kept on attending to help myself.

We must always be ready to help other people who are in trouble. We can give them information about FA, offer hope, and tell how the program helps us recover.</p><p>But we must be tactful in our approach. We take care to simply offer people the FA tools—and then step back and allow them to use these tools if and how they choose.
