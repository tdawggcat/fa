We were confused and in pain, but we found hope in our FA meetings.</p><p>We can’t tell you what to do. We can only share our experiences with you and tell you how we found the strength to deal with our problems. Some of us have loved ones who are recovering from addictive disease. Others of us have loved ones who choose not to recover, at least for the present.</p><p>We’ve learned that we can live fuller, richer lives by studying and practicing the Twelve Steps of Families Anonymous. The despair that brought us to this program no longer dominates our lives. We have learned that we have rights and deserve to be happy, but it’s up to us to create that happiness. These changes did not come about overnight. They happened because we attended our FA meetings, found sponsors, studied the Steps, made phone calls to other members, and turned to a Power greater than ourselves. You are no longer alone. Welcome to Families Anonymous.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> open myself to another so that both of us can be helped.', 1),
('10', 'January 10', 'Acceptance', '<p>Acceptance is not easy. It means that I must look at a situation with honesty and with the realization that sometimes I cannot change it, cure it, or control it. It just is as it is. When I am deeply hurt, I may react with anger or rejection. Disappointment makes it difficult for me to accept the painful reality or the chemical dependency of someone I care about.</p><p>Fear also makes acceptance difficult. I want to rescue instead of letting that person learn the painful lessons of mistakes. I feel helpless, watching as he treads the thin line between rebellion and independence. He rejects my advice, and the consequences are grim.</p><p>The Twelve Steps help me realize and accept the fact that I have no power or authority over another human being. Acceptance means acknowledging that I cannot eliminate chemical dependency, any more than I can make a sick person well.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> invite acceptance to put an end to futile struggles and set me free to grow.', 10),
('100', 'April 9', 'Needing People', '<p>There’s a line in a song that goes, “People who need people are the luckiest people in the world.” I’m one of those lucky people. I’ll be the first to admit that I do need people. I need the people of Families Anonymous.</p><p>When I found FA, my heart was broken in a million pieces, and I didn’t know how to put it back together. I still don’t have every single piece in place, but at least my heart is mending and still beating.</p><p>The wonderful healing fellowship of FA has given me brothers and sisters to whom I can relate, for we are all one with the same problem.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> open my heart to another person as a way to help myself heal.', 100),

They sound all right at meetings, but putting them into practice is another thing.”</p><p>That’s how I felt the first time I attended a Families Anonymous group. But little by little, I came to see that this particular slogan teaches me to be good to myself today, let go of the unhappy times of the past, and avoid worrying about tomorrow.</p><p>It invites me to fill today with as many pleasant experiences as I can and to help others do the same.</p><p>Living one day at a time is especially necessary for those of us who know the pain and confusion of the family disease called chemical dependency. It’s all too easy for us to project problems into the future that may never materialize. Fortunately, we have our friends in FA to help us remember to live one day at a time.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> make this one day a celebration of life.', 101),
('102', 'April 11', 'Self-Pity', '<p>One member of our Families Anonymous group told us that she was so crushed and defeated by her child’s drug addiction that she walked everywhere with her head down and her eyes cast low, so that no one could see her hurt and despair. By doing so, she kept her field of vision extremely limited—cracked sidewalks, bird droppings, mud puddles, and dirty shoes.</p><p>When she found Families Anonymous and stepped out on the Twelve Step road to recovery, she raised her head to see the break in the clouds with sunlight shining through, the birds darting from tree to tree, a rainbow after a shower.</p><p>Had she continued to wallow in self-pity, her eyes would have remained closed to the beauty in each day. If we dwell on the hurts and miseries of yesterday and dread the possible pain of tomorrow, we miss out completely on today.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> broaden my outlook, appreciating the gifts this new day brings.', 102),
('103', 'April 12', 'Self', '<p>“Self” is a powerful word. Attached to other words, it carries either a negative or a positive message. Like so many other intangibles, its impact depends upon the way we use it.</p><p>When we come into the Families Anonymous program, our “selves” are usually negative ones: self-doubt, self-recrimination, self-pity, self-justification, self-blame. At times, we behave in ways that are self-centered, self-serving, self-defeating, and just plain selfish. We do not recognize that we are self-imprisoned in our denial and unwillingness to change.</p><p>But as we work the Twelve Steps, we discover some other “selves”: self-awareness, self-respect, self-control, self-confidence, self-esteem. “I can change myself,” our FA reading tells us. As we grow and change, we discover the lovable, worthy selves that have been there all along.</p><p>If we continue reaching for the positive “selves” that are ours to claim, we eventually arrive at the best “self” of all: selflessness. When we get to that point, nothing pleases our new self more than sharing the program with someone who needs it. As we discover who we are, we let go of negativism and self-centered ways.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> become the best self I can be.', 103),
('104', 'April 13', 'Lessons', '<p>I had to learn to accept many things when I started coming to Families Anonymous. The first thing was powerlessness. Surely I couldn’t be powerless over my own son! After all, hadn’t I managed to control him all these years? Well, if I had, what a mess I’d made of it!</p><p>Now that I have turned over all that control to my Higher Power, things certainly are working better. It’s funny how much we can learn in FA when we get honest with ourselves. And being honest with myself was the second thing I learned in FA.</p><p>How often I had tried to justify my faults. I always had such good reasons for what I said or did! Somehow the truth stands out when we read the FA material over and over.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> acknowledge the many lessons my FA program has taught me.', 104),
('105', 'April 14', 'Control', '<p>Oh, how I tried to control everyone in my life! But all I ended up with was frustration and anger. Why couldn’t my family see that I knew what was best for everyone?</p><p>Thank God I found the Families Anonymous program, for it showed me how to release my loved ones from the tyranny of my nagging ways. Through the FA program, I learned to gain a measure of control over myself—the only person I am capable of controlling. What a feeling of freedom came when I gave up trying to manipulate everybody else’s life and concentrated on doing something positive about my own!</p><p>When I find myself starting to take over again, I remember who is really in charge of my family and me, and I give back to my Higher Power the control I had thought was mine.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> ask my Higher Power to remove any urge I may have to control other people or situations.', 105),
('106', 'April 15', 'Roles', '<p>I kept saying to myself, “My daughter is the one with the problems. She’s the addict who causes all the upheaval in our family.” That was before I found Families Anonymous.</p><p>As I became better informed about addiction, I learned that this disease gets better only when the addict wants it to get better, regardless of how much the family may long for changes.</p><p>Coming to meetings and faithfully reading FA literature, I learned that each member of our family was playing a role. We either helped her move toward recovery or stood in her way. Until we all became aware of the roles we were playing—enabler, persecutor, rescuer, or victim—we would interact in the same old ways, and nothing would change.</p><p>With this new understanding of the addict’s personality and disease, I no longer allow myself to be manipulated or dragged down by the turmoil of her life.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> look carefully at the role I’ve been playing, and then I will take the lead in my own life.', 106),
('107', 'April 16', 'Enabling', '<p>We talk a lot in Families Anonymous about “enabling.” What do we mean? We mean continuing to do those things that allow another person to remain “stuck” in the disease of addiction. Enabling means relieving someone of life’s normal consequences, thereby short-circuiting the process of growth.</p><p>It is so easy for me to step in and “help” when I know I should step back and allow that other person’s room to grow by suffering the consequences of his own mistakes. At times it would be convenient for me to offer help, I find it extremely painful to see my addict struggle alone, although he may be making progress in his own way.</p><p>I find it hard to allow him to suffer pain when I could ease that pain by my enabling. I sometimes think of him as a slow learner, yet when I realize how guilty I am of enabling, I think, “Who am I to judge another person?”</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> remember that when I relieve the pain, I only prolong the illness.', 107),
('108', 'April 17', 'Helping or Controlling?', '<p>How easy it was for me to take over and direct someone I regarded as sick and unable to function! Even after my daughter was in recovery, I continued trying to engineer her life—under the guise of keeping her on the right track. I thought it was not only my right but my duty. Otherwise, what kind of parent would I be?</p><p>The key words are helping and controlling. Through participation in Families Anonymous, I found there is a great difference between help and control. The notion of keeping someone on track denotes control. But I know now that I have no control over any other person.</p><p>I took a long, hard look at myself and realized I needed to change my attitudes and actions. To help my daughter, I had to let her go, with love. My daughter does not need my lectures, threats, promises of rewards, or protection. She does need my encouragement, my faith that she can succeed, and my acceptance of her right to manage her own life.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> let FA help me distinguish between help and control.', 108),
('109', 'April 18', 'Helping', '<p>For me, one of the most difficult obstacles to full participation in the Families Anonymous program arose at the very onset of my involvement. I wanted desperately to help my child! How could I, a loving parent, not do things for her, especially since her use of drugs and alcohol seemed to make her so vulnerable and even more in need of help?</p><p>When I asked this question at FA meetings, the replies never satisfied me until finally I began to understand what my FA friends were trying to tell me. It gradually dawned on me that by doing things for my daughter, I was depriving her of the opportunity to experience the consequences of her behavior. So long as I kept it up, she would never have any reason to want to change her way of living.</p><p>Gradually I stopped doing and learned simply to be. I could be loving and caring without interfering in my child’s decisions. I could be understanding, knowing that she suffers from a disease called alcoholism, and recognizing that only painful experience can motivate her to choose help to get well.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> help by not interfering.', 109),
('11', 'January 11', 'Living in Fear', '<p>As I deal with the person close to me who misuses drugs, my reactions take many forms. Anxiety, fear, worry, and obsession are the chief ones. When I let my imagination run wild, it creates ever-new fears to replace the old ones. The short-lived relief when something I dreaded doesn’t happen is all too often replaced by still more fears.</p><p>This is the insanity we speak of in regard to the family disease of addiction—allowing absorption with the situation to become an obsession that drains all our energy for appreciating the gifts of life today.</p><p>I must consider alternatives or face serious consequences. My life is at stake. How long can I survive in the grip of such damaging fear? After all, I have accomplished nothing with my constant worry about what might happen tomorrow. When I calm down enough to examine my fears, I see that most of them concern the future.</p><p>When I project a future that may never happen, I am only borrowing trouble. Living one day at a time is the only way to have a life.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> name my fear and let it go, and I will look for the gifts of this one day.', 11),
('110', 'April 19', 'A Better Life', '<p>My husband and I are changed people since we joined the Families Anonymous program. Our new attitudes and behaviors have helped in all our relationships—with our son, extended family, friends, and even business acquaintances. We have also seen changes in our drug-dependent son, many of them for the better.</p><p>What are these changes? No longer do we blame ourselves for our son’s problem or overreact to incidents in his life, even if we disapprove. We do not comment unless we are directly asked for our opinions. We no longer overprotect or criticize his lifestyle.</p><p>If he makes errors in judgment, he suffers the consequences. By the same token, when he makes the right decisions, he experiences pride and heightened self-esteem. We now realize that all of us have a right to choose how we want to live.</p><p>We have not abandoned our son. On the contrary, we are in constant communication. We give him our love, our encouragement, and our respect as a human being. Our relationship has improved a great deal.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> enjoy the freedom that goes with a better way of life.', 110),
('111', 'April 20', 'Guilt of a Single Parent', '<p>Before coming to Families Anonymous, I suffered from the “if only” disease. I constantly blamed myself: if only my children had a father in the house! If only I weren’t a working mother! If only we had more money or lived in a different neighborhood! Many single parents suffer an inordinate amount of guilt about “short-changing” their children.</p><p>FA has taught me that I am not to blame when my child seems unable to cope with life on its own terms. Letting go of these guilt feelings helps me to live positively today and to maintain a more objective attitude as I deal with any crises that arise.</p><p>I have finally recovered from the “if only” disease. I have reprogrammed my mental “computer,” eliminating guilt. But I may hang on to one “if only”: if only everyone who needs Families Anonymous could discover its worth!</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> replace guilt with gratitude.', 111),
('112', 'April 21', 'Expectations', '<p>Before I became familiar with the principles of Families Anonymous, my expectations often led to frustration and anger. When I placed all my expectations on others, they resented my attempts at manipulation. And my unreasonable expectations discouraged them from making improvements on their own. When my words and actions did not produce the desired results, I expressed my disappointment through alienation and anger.</p><p>What I’ve learned through FA has changed my attitude about expectations. Nothing is wrong with high hopes, but today I do not allow anything or anyone falling short of the mark to throw me into anger or despair. Instead, I allow others to work on their own shortcomings, while I devote myself to working on mine.</p><p>Today I know that change comes slowly. By keeping my expectations realistic, I minimize my disappointment in myself or others.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> set aside expectations and leave the future to my Higher Power.', 112),
('113', 'April 22', 'Spiritual Awakening', '<p>The Twelfth Step begins, <i>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these Steps...</i> These words really puzzled me when I first came to Families Anonymous. I wondered if I could expect a great enlightenment, complete with thunder or ringing bells.</p><p>For me, the awakening came about in small happenings. It was an awakening when, for the first time, I quietly said, “I love you but I can’t help you. All you have to do is pick up the phone and call Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous.” I had a spiritual awakening on the first morning I looked out the window and thought, “What a beautiful day I feel wonderful.”</p><p>I knew further awakening when, during a meeting, I helped a newcomer toward peace of mind by sharing my growing experiences. When the Serenity Prayer pulled me through a difficult time, I could count that as yet another spiritual awakening.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> be grateful for the miracle of small awakenings.', 113),
('114', 'April 23', 'Step Twelve', '<p>Sometimes I feel reluctant to take Step Twelve. Am I afraid to encounter someone else’s pain, lest I find that mine isn’t as far behind me as I imagine? Have I really looked for someone who needs Families Anonymous? Do I really listen? Do I really see? Is my moment of sunlight too bright to include that person who is in the shadows and still hurting?</p><p>FA teaches me that my spiritual awakening overcomes despair and cynicism. It creates a need to share FA with others, instills a desire to help, frees me to feel compassion and understanding without judging. This awakening enables me to love, to forgive, to live and let live.</p><p>With courage, I can share my experience with those who still stumble in the dark. I can tell of my own awakening, then leave the results of my efforts to a Higher Power.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> carry the message to others who seem to want it, granting them the dignity to receive it or leave it, as they decide.', 114),
('115', 'April 24', 'Step Five', '<p>Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.</p><p>When I admit my faults to God, to myself, and to another human being, it becomes clear that my shortcomings do not make me less worthy, only human.</p><p>Accepting my own frailties and imperfections allows me to accept, without judgment or condemnation, the faults and poor choices of others. Eventually, I am even able to share my human failings in Families Anonymous meetings, helping others to see that we’ve all made similar mistakes.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> remember that making a mistake is being human. Trying to be perfect is “playing God.”', 115),
('116', 'April 25', 'Mistakes', '<p>After many years of living with an alcoholic husband, I had become about as passive as anyone could be. Without being conscious of it, I avoided taking any kind of action, for fear of making a mistake. My craving for perfection was keeping me from having any life of my own.</p><p>When my son went through treatment for chemical dependency, I was encouraged to attend Families Anonymous. Sharing in meetings, working the Steps, reading the literature—all these activities are helping me learn that it’s all right for me to act, and even to make mistakes!</p><p>Human beings all make mistakes at times, and no one expects me to be superhuman. This new understanding has helped me a great deal in all my day-to-day relationships. How good it feels to grow!</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> live as fully as I can and count my mistakes as progress.', 116),
('117', 'April 26', 'On Saying No', '<p>Through practice, I am learning to say no, undaunted by the anger of the addict in my household when he doesn’t get his way. I work hard to overcome my anger at him and the lingering guilt I feel even when I know I’ve done the right thing.</p><p>When I look at his behavior rationally, I see that it comes from immaturity, heightened by misuse of drugs and a long history of getting what he wants.</p><p>Today I have an opportunity to change my responses to his behavior. I can stand up for myself my values, say no when it’s appropriate, and give him a chance to adjust to a recovering new me.</p><p>Having been a “doormat” for so long, I know it will take time, patience, and consistency for me to be able to say no and feel good about it.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> congratulate myself when I am strong enough to say no.', 117),
('118', 'April 27', 'Sarcasm', '<p>Before I came to this program, I used sarcasm to hurt, to get my point across, to get rid of anger. I was hurting, and I wanted to hurt back.</p><p>After some time in the Families Anonymous program, however, I became aware of just how biting and hurtful sarcasm really is. It attacks self-esteem and destroys initiative. I decided there were better ways of dealing with those around me.</p><p>In learning to accept people as they are, I can catch myself now when I’m tempted to fall back on my old sarcastic ways. As I continue to work on my own inventory, a new awareness of my defects helps me to think before I speak.</p><p>When I say the Serenity Prayer, I ask for courage to change the things I can, and one of those things I can change is myself.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> abandon sarcasm in favor of kindness.', 118),
('119', 'April 28', 'Inventory', '<p>Before I came to Families Anonymous, I had lost all faith in myself as a parent and even as a worthy person. Overcome with guilt, remorse, and self-pity, I had gradually lost the respect of my children, my peers, and even myself.</p><p>Through the Fourth Step, FA has helped me see my faults, real and imagined. But beyond those faults, I have also discovered my assets. I have found much that needs to be changed. I’ve also found a lot in me that is good.</p><p>Focusing on new objectives has enhanced my self-esteem. Working on changing my attitudes has restored my initiative and respect for myself. Grateful for these changes, I’m now able to reach out to others, both in and out of my group, with confidence that I can be of help in some small way.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> identify one defect and work to change it; then I will look for an asset of which I can be proud.', 119),
('12', 'January 12', 'Step Two', '<p>Came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</p><p>My first reaction to this Step was indignation. I came to the Families Anonymous program to change my child’s behavior, and now this Step tells me that I am insane.</p><p>I steamed about this Step for quite a while. It was only with the help of others in my group that I finally came to see that if I wasn’t insane, some of my actions certainly were. Through the patience of my FA friends, I came to realize that I had gone to insane lengths to try to change the behavior of my drug-using child, refusing to admit that I lacked the power or ability to do so.</p><p>Gradually, I came to believe I could be restored to sanity if I listened with an open mind and delayed judgment on those ideas that had sounded too radical at first. With the help of a Power greater than myself, I could change my outlook. And at that point my own healing would begin.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> cease relying on my own power and begin trusting in a greater Power.', 12),
('120', 'April 29', 'Anger', '<p>In my opinion, the purpose of going to Families Anonymous is to gain peace and serenity. One of the ways I do this is by backing away any time my “problem person” is angry. I’ve observed that regardless of what he’s angry about, he usually vents his hostility on those who care about him most. He knows we will always forgive and love him, whereas strangers or mere acquaintances won’t tolerate his attacks.</p><p>Today I choose never to accept verbal abuse or temper tantrums from the addict. After several years in FA, I am able to ask him serenely to leave my house if he starts to act out. When he becomes antagonistic toward me for any reason, I can tell him calmly that I choose to not speak any further.</p><p>At times I ask him to consider me a stranger when he speaks to me, because he would not be disrespectful toward a stranger. I try to let him know I will communicate with him at any time, so long as we can do so civilly and without anger toward each other. And I emphasize that I love him, even though I reject his angry attacks.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> assert my right to serenity and respect.', 120),

What’s more, I used to make it my mission in life to help others mend their ways, make better choices, and improve their lives. I even offered God a few valuable suggestions!</p><p>But when I came to the program of Families Anonymous and committed myself to the Twelve Steps, humility worked its way into my thinking. I realized I do not have all the answers. My children must make their own responses to life. I cannot do it for them. And I cannot imagine the kind of world my grandchildren will inhabit, so how can I know what’s best for them?

The painful past has finally been put to rest. But the Tenth Step is also a humbling reminder that there is no final stage of perfection. A slip backwards to old negative patterns is always a possibility, and I need to be on guard every day against egotistic pride and false pride.

We allow ourselves to feel like parental failures because our children are not fulfilling the images we projected when they were infants. How silly we are to think this way! How self-important to believe that everything depends on us!</p><p>Our children make their own choices. Most of us did the best parenting we could with all the knowledge and skill we possessed.

But I know that my hesitation in rejoicing can be unlearned. The Families Anonymous Twelve Step program is helping me learn how to do it.</p><p>Study of FA literature has helped me to take one day at a time and to live in this moment and savor it.

But I can begin by countering pride with humility. In this program, humility does not mean self-abasement or groveling. Humility, as FA sees it, means taking a good look at myself and finding that I am neither all-powerful nor all-knowing. It means seeing myself as I really am, with full recognition of my good qualities as well as my faults.</p><p>When I make an honest appraisal of myself, I achieve a new dimension of self-awareness. Playing down or denying my good qualities would be dishonest, so I gratefully acknowledge these assets as gifts from God and try to use them in my life.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> guard against pride and arrogance and seek to grow in true humility.', 8),

We are even told that service helps us recover from the family illness that keeps our homes in turmoil. “How will my setting up the chairs and preparing coffee make my situation any better?” I wondered. Reluctantly, I took on the job of treasurer and ordered literature from the World Service Office.</p><p>Before long, I was well acquainted with all of the FA publications and had learned a lot about the program. Later, I took on the job of group secretary for a period of six months. These responsibilities drew me back to meetings and kept me growing in the program.

I wasn’t sure why I needed to do this, but all through the following week I kept this thought in mind. Every time I started to tell someone what to do, I would ask myself, “Is this any of my business? Is that my responsibility?”</p><p>In a household with my spouse and three teenagers, I usually found the answer to be, “No.” So I tried to work my program, and mine alone. It wasn’t always comfortable. I was sure my way was better, and things didn’t get done as quickly as I would have liked. I bit my tongue and turned to my own tasks anyway.</p><p>By the end of the week, I felt pretty good. I was under far less pressure, and I even found some free time for myself.</p><p>Working my own program is a basic part of life for me today. I no longer waste time wondering what someone else is doing or saying. If I’m supposed to know, I’ll hear soon enough.

This illness often causes us to lose some of our best attributes, such as humor, imagination, and creativity.</p><p>When I realize I’ve become filled to the brim with resentment, bitterness, sarcasm, self-pity, and despair, I put my creative imagination to work. Visualizing myself as a pitcher, I mentally pour myself out, emptying myself completely of every drop of negativity, discouragement, and despair. When they are all gone, I then sit quietly for a bit and fill myself again—this time with faith, forgiveness, honesty, gratitude, patience, humor, and praise.</p><p>Once I have recharged myself with these fresh new thoughts, I can then imagine I am a cool pitcher filled from a well of serenity. Other thirsty FA members can “drink” from this same well, so they too can be refreshed.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> live in the joy that comes from thinking life-giving thoughts.', 84),

But the Higher Power of my understanding can also show kindness, mercy, compassion, and love. And these are the attributes I am prone to overlook.</p><p>How often in the past I searched for the impossible and tried to assume a power that was not mine to possess! I set up expectations for my family and roles for my children, trying to make them clones or mirror images of myself. I created difficulties for myself and others when my hopes and dreams fell victim to reality.</p><p>My poor fantasies and unrealistic expectations can never equal the beauty and power of the true creation that surrounds us all. I can use what little power I possess to create confusion, crisis, disappointment, self-defeat, chaos, and discontent. Or I can use my power to create acceptance, harmony, loving detachment, encouragement, and peace.

I now accept the reality that my drug-dependent son suffers from a disease. I accept the fact that his behavior is often unacceptable. Even though the choices he makes are his, and his alone, I don’t have to like them or approve the way he lives his life.</p><p>Through acceptance, I become able to live my own life and involve myself in fulfilling activities without thinking of what my son might be doing with his life. I do this, recognizing all the while that what he makes of his life is up to him, so long as none of my rights get trampled on.</p><p>Acceptance has allowed me to change: from fretting and being constantly on edge to feeling free in my mind; from walking on eggs to standing firm; and from crying to caring, even amid unsolved problems.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> accept what is, stand up for myself, and work for what may yet be.', 86),

Now I realize that my drug-dependent children’s anger usually has little to do with me and is often just their way of avoiding responsibility for their own actions.

How important is it for me to offer my opinion at all? How important is it for me to take someone else’s inventory? How important is it to be right, listened to, or obeyed?

I found that honest sharing of similar experiences brings a different perspective. My burdens didn’t seem so heavy after I shared them, and I gained insight from hearing how others had handled much worse situations. At the end of that evening, I was even smiling myself.</p><p>The humor I found at FA helped me overcome my fear of being there.
