We were confused and in pain, but we found hope in our FA meetings.</p><p>We can’t tell you what to do. We can only share our experiences with you and tell you how we found the strength to deal with our problems. Some of us have loved ones who are recovering from addictive disease. Others of us have loved ones who choose not to recover, at least for the present.</p><p>We’ve learned that we can live fuller, richer lives by studying and practicing the Twelve Steps of Families Anonymous. The despair that brought us to this program no longer dominates our lives. We have learned that we have rights and deserve to be happy, but it’s up to us to create that happiness. These changes did not come about overnight. They happened because we attended our FA meetings, found sponsors, studied the Steps, made phone calls to other members, and turned to a Power greater than ourselves. You are no longer alone. Welcome to Families Anonymous.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> open myself to another so that both of us can be helped.', 1),
('10', 'January 10', 'Acceptance', '<p>Acceptance is not easy. It means that I must look at a situation with honesty and with the realization that sometimes I cannot change it, cure it, or control it. It just is as it is. When I am deeply hurt, I may react with anger or rejection. Disappointment makes it difficult for me to accept the painful reality or the chemical dependency of someone I care about.</p><p>Fear also makes acceptance difficult. I want to rescue instead of letting that person learn the painful lessons of mistakes. I feel helpless, watching as he treads the thin line between rebellion and independence. He rejects my advice, and the consequences are grim.</p><p>The Twelve Steps help me realize and accept the fact that I have no power or authority over another human being. Acceptance means acknowledging that I cannot eliminate chemical dependency, any more than I can make a sick person well.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> invite acceptance to put an end to futile struggles and set me free to grow.', 10),

I’ll be the first to admit that I do need people. I need the people of Families Anonymous.</p><p>When I found FA, my heart was broken in a million pieces, and I didn’t know how to put it back together. I still don’t have every single piece in place, but at least my heart is mending and still beating.</p><p>The wonderful healing fellowship of FA has given me brothers and sisters to whom I can relate, for we are all one with the same problem.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> open my heart to another person as a way to help myself heal.', 100),

They sound all right at meetings, but putting them into practice is another thing.”</p><p>That’s how I felt the first time I attended a Families Anonymous group. But little by little, I came to see that this particular slogan teaches me to be good to myself today, let go of the unhappy times of the past, and avoid worrying about tomorrow.</p><p>It invites me to fill today with as many pleasant experiences as I can and to help others do the same.</p><p>Living one day at a time is especially necessary for those of us who know the pain and confusion of the family disease called chemical dependency. It’s all too easy for us to project problems into the future that may never materialize. Fortunately, we have our friends in FA to help us remember to live one day at a time.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> make this one day a celebration of life.', 101),

By doing so, she kept her field of vision extremely limited—cracked sidewalks, bird droppings, mud puddles, and dirty shoes.</p><p>When she found Families Anonymous and stepped out on the Twelve Step road to recovery, she raised her head to see the break in the clouds with sunlight shining through, the birds darting from tree to tree, a rainbow after a shower.</p><p>Had she continued to wallow in self-pity, her eyes would have remained closed to the beauty in each day. If we dwell on the hurts and miseries of yesterday and dread the possible pain of tomorrow, we miss out completely on today.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> broaden my outlook, appreciating the gifts this new day brings.', 102),
('103', 'April 12', 'Self', '<p>“Self” is a powerful word. Attached to other words, it carries either a negative or a positive message. Like so many other intangibles, its impact depends upon the way we use it.</p><p>When we come into the Families Anonymous program, our “selves” are usually negative ones: self-doubt, self-recrimination, self-pity, self-justification, self-blame. At times, we behave in ways that are self-centered, self-serving, self-defeating, and just plain selfish. We do not recognize that we are self-imprisoned in our denial and unwillingness to change.</p><p>But as we work the Twelve Steps, we discover some other “selves”: self-awareness, self-respect, self-control, self-confidence, self-esteem. “I can change myself,” our FA reading tells us. As we grow and change, we discover the lovable, worthy selves that have been there all along.</p><p>If we continue reaching for the positive “selves” that are ours to claim, we eventually arrive at the best “self” of all: selflessness. When we get to that point, nothing pleases our new self more than sharing the program with someone who needs it. As we discover who we are, we let go of negativism and self-centered ways.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> become the best self I can be.', 103),
('104', 'April 13', 'Lessons', '<p>I had to learn to accept many things when I started coming to Families Anonymous. The first thing was powerlessness. Surely I couldn’t be powerless over my own son! After all, hadn’t I managed to control him all these years? Well, if I had, what a mess I’d made of it!</p><p>Now that I have turned over all that control to my Higher Power, things certainly are working better. It’s funny how much we can learn in FA when we get honest with ourselves. And being honest with myself was the second thing I learned in FA.</p><p>How often I had tried to justify my faults. I always had such good reasons for what I said or did! Somehow the truth stands out when we read the FA material over and over.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> acknowledge the many lessons my FA program has taught me.', 104),
('105', 'April 14', 'Control', '<p>Oh, how I tried to control everyone in my life! But all I ended up with was frustration and anger. Why couldn’t my family see that I knew what was best for everyone?</p><p>Thank God I found the Families Anonymous program, for it showed me how to release my loved ones from the tyranny of my nagging ways. Through the FA program, I learned to gain a measure of control over myself—the only person I am capable of controlling. What a feeling of freedom came when I gave up trying to manipulate everybody else’s life and concentrated on doing something positive about my own!</p><p>When I find myself starting to take over again, I remember who is really in charge of my family and me, and I give back to my Higher Power the control I had thought was mine.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> ask my Higher Power to remove any urge I may have to control other people or situations.', 105),
('106', 'April 15', 'Roles', '<p>I kept saying to myself, “My daughter is the one with the problems. She’s the addict who causes all the upheaval in our family.” That was before I found Families Anonymous.</p><p>As I became better informed about addiction, I learned that this disease gets better only when the addict wants it to get better, regardless of how much the family may long for changes.</p><p>Coming to meetings and faithfully reading FA literature, I learned that each member of our family was playing a role. We either helped her move toward recovery or stood in her way. Until we all became aware of the roles we were playing—enabler, persecutor, rescuer, or victim—we would interact in the same old ways, and nothing would change.</p><p>With this new understanding of the addict’s personality and disease, I no longer allow myself to be manipulated or dragged down by the turmoil of her life.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> look carefully at the role I’ve been playing, and then I will take the lead in my own life.', 106),
('107', 'April 16', 'Enabling', '<p>We talk a lot in Families Anonymous about “enabling.” What do we mean? We mean continuing to do those things that allow another person to remain “stuck” in the disease of addiction. Enabling means relieving someone of life’s normal consequences, thereby short-circuiting the process of growth.</p><p>It is so easy for me to step in and “help” when I know I should step back and allow that other person’s room to grow by suffering the consequences of his own mistakes. At times it would be convenient for me to offer help, I find it extremely painful to see my addict struggle alone, although he may be making progress in his own way.</p><p>I find it hard to allow him to suffer pain when I could ease that pain by my enabling. I sometimes think of him as a slow learner, yet when I realize how guilty I am of enabling, I think, “Who am I to judge another person?”</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> remember that when I relieve the pain, I only prolong the illness.', 107),
('108', 'April 17', 'Helping or Controlling?', '<p>How easy it was for me to take over and direct someone I regarded as sick and unable to function! Even after my daughter was in recovery, I continued trying to engineer her life—under the guise of keeping her on the right track. I thought it was not only my right but my duty. Otherwise, what kind of parent would I be?</p><p>The key words are helping and controlling. Through participation in Families Anonymous, I found there is a great difference between help and control. The notion of keeping someone on track denotes control. But I know now that I have no control over any other person.</p><p>I took a long, hard look at myself and realized I needed to change my attitudes and actions. To help my daughter, I had to let her go, with love. My daughter does not need my lectures, threats, promises of rewards, or protection. She does need my encouragement, my faith that she can succeed, and my acceptance of her right to manage her own life.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> let FA help me distinguish between help and control.', 108),
('109', 'April 18', 'Helping', '<p>For me, one of the most difficult obstacles to full participation in the Families Anonymous program arose at the very onset of my involvement. I wanted desperately to help my child! How could I, a loving parent, not do things for her, especially since her use of drugs and alcohol seemed to make her so vulnerable and even more in need of help?</p><p>When I asked this question at FA meetings, the replies never satisfied me until finally I began to understand what my FA friends were trying to tell me. It gradually dawned on me that by doing things for my daughter, I was depriving her of the opportunity to experience the consequences of her behavior. So long as I kept it up, she would never have any reason to want to change her way of living.</p><p>Gradually I stopped doing and learned simply to be. I could be loving and caring without interfering in my child’s decisions. I could be understanding, knowing that she suffers from a disease called alcoholism, and recognizing that only painful experience can motivate her to choose help to get well.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> help by not interfering.', 109),
('11', 'January 11', 'Living in Fear', '<p>As I deal with the person close to me who misuses drugs, my reactions take many forms. Anxiety, fear, worry, and obsession are the chief ones. When I let my imagination run wild, it creates ever-new fears to replace the old ones. The short-lived relief when something I dreaded doesn’t happen is all too often replaced by still more fears.</p><p>This is the insanity we speak of in regard to the family disease of addiction—allowing absorption with the situation to become an obsession that drains all our energy for appreciating the gifts of life today.</p><p>I must consider alternatives or face serious consequences. My life is at stake. How long can I survive in the grip of such damaging fear? After all, I have accomplished nothing with my constant worry about what might happen tomorrow. When I calm down enough to examine my fears, I see that most of them concern the future.</p><p>When I project a future that may never happen, I am only borrowing trouble. Living one day at a time is the only way to have a life.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> name my fear and let it go, and I will look for the gifts of this one day.', 11),
('110', 'April 19', 'A Better Life', '<p>My husband and I are changed people since we joined the Families Anonymous program. Our new attitudes and behaviors have helped in all our relationships—with our son, extended family, friends, and even business acquaintances. We have also seen changes in our drug-dependent son, many of them for the better.</p><p>What are these changes? No longer do we blame ourselves for our son’s problem or overreact to incidents in his life, even if we disapprove. We do not comment unless we are directly asked for our opinions. We no longer overprotect or criticize his lifestyle.</p><p>If he makes errors in judgment, he suffers the consequences. By the same token, when he makes the right decisions, he experiences pride and heightened self-esteem. We now realize that all of us have a right to choose how we want to live.</p><p>We have not abandoned our son. On the contrary, we are in constant communication. We give him our love, our encouragement, and our respect as a human being. Our relationship has improved a great deal.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> enjoy the freedom that goes with a better way of life.', 110),
('111', 'April 20', 'Guilt of a Single Parent', '<p>Before coming to Families Anonymous, I suffered from the “if only” disease. I constantly blamed myself: if only my children had a father in the house! If only I weren’t a working mother! If only we had more money or lived in a different neighborhood! Many single parents suffer an inordinate amount of guilt about “short-changing” their children.</p><p>FA has taught me that I am not to blame when my child seems unable to cope with life on its own terms. Letting go of these guilt feelings helps me to live positively today and to maintain a more objective attitude as I deal with any crises that arise.</p><p>I have finally recovered from the “if only” disease. I have reprogrammed my mental “computer,” eliminating guilt. But I may hang on to one “if only”: if only everyone who needs Families Anonymous could discover its worth!</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> replace guilt with gratitude.', 111),
('12', 'January 12', 'Step Two', '<p>Came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</p><p>My first reaction to this Step was indignation. I came to the Families Anonymous program to change my child’s behavior, and now this Step tells me that I am insane.</p><p>I steamed about this Step for quite a while. It was only with the help of others in my group that I finally came to see that if I wasn’t insane, some of my actions certainly were. Through the patience of my FA friends, I came to realize that I had gone to insane lengths to try to change the behavior of my drug-using child, refusing to admit that I lacked the power or ability to do so.</p><p>Gradually, I came to believe I could be restored to sanity if I listened with an open mind and delayed judgment on those ideas that had sounded too radical at first. With the help of a Power greater than myself, I could change my outlook. And at that point my own healing would begin.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> cease relying on my own power and begin trusting in a greater Power.', 12),
('13', 'January 13', 'To Be or What to Be?', '<p>The Families Anonymous reading titled Helping says, “My role as helper is not to do things for the person I am trying to help, but to be things...”</p><p>At first I wondered what I should be. Over time, as I continued to participate in FA meetings, I learned the value of being...</p><p>- responsible for my own feelings<br>- strong enough to stand up for my rights<br>- loving enough to allow others to be what they choose to be<br>- aware of the realities in my life<br>- rational in a crisis<br>- consistent in my FA program, to the best of my ability<br>- diligent in my study of the Twelve Steps</p><p>I know that living this way will bring me serenity. As a fringe benefit, my example may also inspire those I would like to help.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> be the best ME that I can be.', 13),
('14', 'January 14', 'TLC', '<p>To most people, TLC means “tender loving care.” In Families Anonymous, TLC can mean “tough loving care.” If I really love someone in a healthy way, I will refuse to let that someone manipulate me. I will no longer allow another person to be the hub of my universe or the focus of my own happiness in life.</p><p>TLC means that I stop participating in the games played by someone who misuses alcohol or other drugs. I stop covering up his mistakes and refuse to make excuses for his behavior. I may even have to say, “I love you, but I can only live with a person who is clean, sober, and responsible. I love you, but I will not bail you out of jail. I love you, but I will not pay fines or attorney’s fees to get you out of trouble.”</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> practice the kind of tough loving care that nourishes the growth of myself and others.', 14),
('15', 'January 15', 'Energy Conservation', '<p>Families Anonymous is an energy-conservation program. As soon as I began to apply the Serenity Prayer and the Twelve Steps to my everyday life, I stopped wasting energy. No longer do I fret over what I see as the wrong actions of others. I need not waste my breath on long lectures. I don’t have to protect others from the consequences of their own mistakes. Best of all, I can cease doing things for my loved one in an effort to change him.</p><p>I find now that I have time for myself to take up a new hobby or renew an old one, read a book, enjoy music, go shopping, work out, plant a garden, play tennis, or putter around the workshop. I have the energy and clear mind I need to do my own work and enrich my life.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> use my energy for living my own life more fully.', 15),
('16', 'January 16', 'A Higher Power', '<p>Being in Families Anonymous a few months revealed to me that for many years I had tried to be my loved one’s Higher Power. But things went badly. Obviously I was not qualified for the job!</p><p>Then somewhere I heard the prayer, “God, make me a channel of your love, and let me know when I get in the way.”</p><p>Hearing that, I could see myself casting a huge shadow over my son’s life. By shielding him, I was blocking out a Higher Power he could understand. I needed to step aside and let my loved one see for himself.</p><p>The FA program gave me the strength to stop fixing, rescuing, instructing, sheltering, and all the other enabling actions I always did as a parent. I was soon rewarded with the opportunity to see a boy become a man. And in the process I became a person in my own right.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> have faith in my Higher Power, myself, and those I love.', 16),
('17', 'January 17', 'Detachment', '<p>A word we frequently hear at Families Anonymous meetings is “detachment.” One might imagine that detaching means giving up all love for the chemically dependent person. But this is far from the truth.</p><p>Once we detach ourselves from involvement in the illness of drug or alcohol abuse, we can freely love the person who has the illness. We do not stop caring; we simply detach emotionally from the user’s problems. We can pull away and refuse to get tangled up in the consequences of chemical abuse.</p><p>We let our loved ones feel the painful results of the drugs. We allow them to accept responsibility for their own actions. We stop protecting them. For it is pain that lets a sick person know that he or she needs treatment, and it is pain that often leads to healing and recovery.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> remember that I help the most when I help the least.', 17),
('18', 'January 18', 'To Believe or Not to Believe?', '<p>Do I constantly watch and wait to catch my addicted loved one using drugs, or do I turn a blind eye to those things I’d rather not see? Do I pry into her personal effects, hunting for proof, or do I ignore the obvious? Do I believe everything she tells me, or do I refuse to believe a word she says? Which attitude leaves me with greater self-respect?</p><p>Whether using or abstaining, the addict needs my trust, compassion, and understanding. Above all, she needs the dignity to make choices and to experience the consequences of her decisions. When her choices are damaging, she will grow by learning from her mistakes. When they are wise, she will experience many rewards.</p><p>If I must face up to something unpleasant, I will try to do so honestly, then let it go. Until then, my own life will be more serene if I have faith and detach instead of searching for the lie.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> choose to believe the best of others, in so far as circumstances will allow.', 18),
('19', 'January 19', 'Power', '<p>Families Anonymous taught me there are two ways of looking at Step One. It is true that I am powerless over someone else’s life. On the other hand, it is equally true that everyone else is powerless over mine.</p><p>For a time, the drug user in my life had complete control of our home and happiness. His actions left me feeling nervous, sleepless, angry, and afraid. I was reacting to unpleasant situations in ways I didn’t like, and he capitalized on my weakness.</p><p>Families Anonymous helped me understand that others have such power over me only if I give it to them.</p><p>I keep coming to meetings to learn, step by step, how to regain control of my own life and stop giving away that control to others, no matter how much I love them.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> claim my power to bring about my own serenity.', 19),
('2', 'January 2', 'Hope', '<p>When I attended my first Families Anonymous meeting, I met people with the same problems I had. They were going through experiences just like my own. They seemed to know exactly what was going on in my home.</p><p>The immediate relief of finding people I could identify with was astonishing. Their stories were similar to mine, and they were cheerful, helpful, supportive, and encouraging. I felt my first ray of hope. Surely I, too, could learn to cope.</p><p>The FA program promised that I could find better ways to deal with life even though someone close to me was an addict. I listened to everyone and made a commitment to <i>keep coming back</i>. I felt such a great relief!

('20', 'January 20', 'Keep It Simple', '<p>Our Families Anonymous slogans are life-savers for new members of the program. When we are floundering in the heavy seas of the family disease of addiction, anything that helps us stay afloat seems like a miracle.

Everything!</p><p>I want to keep things as simple, direct, and clean as possible, because my life has become confused, cluttered, and chaotic. I have lost sight of what matters and what doesn’t.

Keeping it simple means going to meetings regularly and doing the Step that’s appropriate at this stage of my recovery, without trying to do all twelve at once. It means reading some short piece of recovery literature daily. It means keeping my sleep sufficient, my exercise regular, my diet healthy, and my communications clear.</p><p>When that old, familiar mass of confused, chaotic, compulsive thought starts to surge up in my mind, I remind myself to Keep it simple and let go of everything that doesn’t matter at this second, this minute, this hour, and this day.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> keep everything as simple as I can.', 20),

I go to find out how they can smile and have hope in spite of unsolved problems. If I listen, I can learn how the Twelve Steps have helped others and how they can benefit me.</p><p>It feels good to go to FA meetings and express my negative thoughts and feelings. But unless I replace my negative attitudes with better ones, they’ll only creep back into my consciousness.</p><p>It’s important to share at meetings, but it’s equally important to listen. If I do all the talking at meetings, I’ll miss many ideas that may give me new insights. And I cannot give my attention to what others say if I am consumed with my own thoughts.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> listen and learn, allowing new ideas to enter my awareness.', 21),

This illness often causes us to lose some of our best attributes, such as humor, imagination, and creativity.</p><p>When I realize I’ve become filled to the brim with resentment, bitterness, sarcasm, self-pity, and despair, I put my creative imagination to work. Visualizing myself as a pitcher, I mentally pour myself out, emptying myself completely of every drop of negativity, discouragement, and despair. When they are all gone, I then sit quietly for a bit and fill myself again—this time with faith, forgiveness, honesty, gratitude, patience, humor, and praise.</p><p>Once I have recharged myself with these fresh new thoughts, I can then imagine I am a cool pitcher filled from a well of serenity.

And these are the attributes I am prone to overlook.</p><p>How often in the past I searched for the impossible and tried to assume a power that was not mine to possess! I set up expectations for my family and roles for my children, trying to make them clones or mirror images of myself. I created difficulties for myself and others when my hopes and dreams fell victim to reality.</p><p>My poor fantasies and unrealistic expectations can never equal the beauty and power of the true creation that surrounds us all. I can use what little power I possess to create confusion, crisis, disappointment, self-defeat, chaos, and discontent.

I now accept the reality that my drug-dependent son suffers from a disease. I accept the fact that his behavior is often unacceptable. Even though the choices he makes are his, and his alone, I don’t have to like them or approve the way he lives his life.</p><p>Through acceptance, I become able to live my own life and involve myself in fulfilling activities without thinking of what my son might be doing with his life. I do this, recognizing all the while that what he makes of his life is up to him, so long as none of my rights get trampled on.</p><p>Acceptance has allowed me to change: from fretting and being constantly on edge to feeling free in my mind; from walking on eggs to standing firm; and from crying to caring, even amid unsolved problems.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> accept what is, stand up for myself, and work for what may yet be.', 86),

Now I realize that my drug-dependent children’s anger usually has little to do with me and is often just their way of avoiding responsibility for their own actions. And often it’s their own self-hatred being projected outward onto someone or something else.</p><p>As I see my own self-confidence and inner strength grow through working the FA program, I no longer allow myself to be hurt by my children’s anger or anyone else’s. I am able to remain calmer and more objective even in the face of other people’s rage.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> claim my own serenity in spite of someone else’s anger.', 87),

With the support of others in my FA group, I’ve learned to maintain positive attitudes in the midst of these frustrations.</p><p>FA has helped me stop thinking of myself as a failure. The program reminds me that any failures are in the past. I know today that I can make the best of the present situation and build on it. FA has led me to accept myself first, which then helps me to be more accepting of others. Once I have done that, I can make further steps toward recovery.</p><p>FA shows me that anger is a normal human emotion, one that I can express and use constructively. I don’t allow it to dominate me.</p><p>FA reminds me that I cannot control my child.

With steady use, the slogans become dependable internal ‘tapes’ that can reconfigure and rebalance our thinking when we slip back into old, unproductive ways.</p><p>How important is it? is one of my favorite slogans. How important is it for me to offer my opinion at all? How important is it for me to take someone else’s inventory? How important is it to be right, listened to, or obeyed? All of these questions remind me when I am straying from the straight path of recovery, getting bogged down in detours and dead ends.</p><p>How important is it? got me through my son’s determination to wear earrings and jeans with holes in them. How important is it? reminded me that my daughter’s friends do not have to be my friends. How important is it? prodded me to get myself to an FA meeting when I was sinking into apathy and depression.

I tried to control, to change people, to talk sense to my addict, but I did not pray.</p><p>I needed God, so I started trying to pray. But after I found Families Anonymous and reached the point of preparing for Step Eleven, I discovered I’d been praying for control over people and events. I had been treating God as an errand boy who was supposed to carry out my orders. I was talking but never listening.</p><p>True prayer and meditation call for honest sharing of pain and hopes, reflection on all that I have learned about my role in the larger scheme of things, trust in a Higher Power, and a willingness to listen and wait.</p><p>I was grateful when I could allow Step Eleven to help me grow in patience, understanding, and wisdom.</p>', '<b><i>TODAY I WILL</i></b> seek a quiet place and time to improve my conscious contact with God.', 90),

I was desperate to find a way to help them.</p><p>The FA fellowship helped me realize that in order to be of help to them, I must first be willing to be helped myself. With the readings, meetings, and the Twelve Steps to rely on, I started learning to do this one day at a time.</p><p>Eventually my panic was replaced by the realization that I could not handle this crisis alone. I asked my Higher Power to give me the wisdom I desperately needed.

Life did not turn into a garden of roses. She changed, but I didn’t. She had a program and began getting well, while I continued my own obsessive efforts to manage her life, even though she was 37 years old.</p><p>Finally she let go of me and told me there was a program for people like me if I wanted to feel better. After “all I’d done for her,” I felt deserted.</p><p>But it eventually go to Families Anonymous. At first it seemed as though I had found a whole group of people who needed my help! I was probably the first person that anyone ever wanted to kick out of FA. Fortunately, my group was very patient with me. Weeks and months went by, until I finally settled down to get to know myself. What a pain I was!

Why, some members actually laughed out loud! At the time, it seemed to me like laughing at a funeral.</p><p>Before the meeting ended, I realized they had a bond. I found that honest sharing of similar experiences brings a different perspective. My burdens didn’t seem so heavy after I shared them, and I gained insight from hearing how others had handled much worse situations. At the end of that evening, I was even smiling myself.</p><p>The humor I found at FA helped me overcome my fear of being there. Humor initiated a change in my attitude, offered hope, and kept me coming back for more.

('94', 'April 3', 'It Works for Me', '<p>When my son entered a treatment program, I learned that chemical dependency is a disease. In the aftercare program, I learned about Families Anonymous.

My FA group supplied caring friends and a safe place to share both problems and progress with others who understand.</p><p>Today I work on my own recovery, even though my son has not yet achieved sobriety. He continues to use drugs, and this creates many stressful situations. Without the support of FA, I wouldn’t be coping with this situation at all.</p><p>I have learned how vitally important it is for me to work my program, take care of myself, and turn my son and myself over to our Higher Power.

Why couldn’t we fix this problem ourselves?</p><p>As I began to understand her illness and its destructive effects on me, my anger was soon replaced by a rekindled love for my daughter and a personal commitment to do what I could to help both of us recover.</p><p>The principles of FA have helped me change the only one I can change—myself.

He also told me that her addiction was not my fault.</p><p>Both of these ideas were new to me. They gave me a welcome feeling of relief and the beginnings of new insight into our situation.</p><p>At first I went to FA to help my daughter, but after a few meetings I kept on attending to help myself.

We must always be ready to help other people who are in trouble. We can give them information about FA, offer hope, and tell how the program helps us recover.</p><p>But we must be tactful in our approach.
